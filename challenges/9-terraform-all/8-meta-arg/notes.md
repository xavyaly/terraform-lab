Initializing the backend...
There are some problems with the configuration, described below.

The Terraform configuration must be valid before initialization so that
Terraform can determine which modules and providers need to be installed.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you
run "terraform apply" now.

# Now create a new file variables.tf and change in main.tf

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v4.67.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
